This project focuses on building a sales prediction model using various machine learning algorithms to predict the sales of products in retail outlets. The dataset contains multiple features, including product attributes, outlet characteristics, and sales figures. The project performs data preprocessing, such as handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and feature engineering to improve the model's performance.

Several machine learning models, including Linear Regression, Ridge Regression, Decision Trees, and Random Forest Regressors, are implemented and compared. The models are evaluated based on performance metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) to assess prediction accuracy. The final model is used to predict sales on the test dataset, aiming to improve decision-making for retail outlets based on the predicted sales patterns.
